**Description:**
 We using Express.js, which is a special tool for making web stuff with JavaScript. It's not too complicated, so it's good for starting out.

If you want to learn more about Express.js and how it works, you can check out the official guide [here](https://expressjs.com/). It might seem a bit tricky at first, but it gets easier as you practice.

**Beginner Project Idea:**
We are making a To-Do List. It's kind of like making a list of things you need to do. You can add new tasks, check them off when they're done, and delete them.
